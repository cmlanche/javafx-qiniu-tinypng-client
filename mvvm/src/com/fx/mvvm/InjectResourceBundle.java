/**
 * This annotation can be used to let mvvmFX inject the specified {@link ResourceBundle} into your {@link ViewModel}
 * and/or {@link FxmlView}/{@link JavaView}.
 * 
 * The annotation has to be set on a field of type {@link ResourceBundle}.
 * 
 * For fxml based views there are three options to get the ResourceBundle:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The mvvmFX mechanism using this annotation.</li>
 * <li>The standard mechanism provided by the JavaFX runtime using naming conventions.</li>
 * <li>Using the Interface {@link Initializable} provided by the JavaFX runtime.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The mvvmFX mechanism is independent from the standard JavaFX mechanism and can be used at the same time (even if this
 * isn't really useful). The difference is that the mvvmFX mechanism can be more explicit and more checks are done:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If there is a field annotated with this annotation but the type of the field isn't fitting ResourceBundle an
 * {@link IllegalStateException} will be thrown.</li>
 * <li>If there is a View/ViewModel that has a field with this annotation but <b>no</b> ResourceBundle is provided when
 * the view is loaded, an {@link IllegalStateException} will be thrown.</li>
 * <li>If the View/ViewModel has a field with this annotation and the attribute {@link #optional()} is set to
 * <code>true</code> (default value is <code>false</code>) and <b>no</b> ResourceBundle is provided when the view is
 * loaded, <b>no</b> exception will be thrown and no ResourceBundle will be injected. You have to check for
 * <code>null</code> in this case.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
