/**
 * This interface defines a common set of methods that the root application classes of extensions of mvvmfx should
 * implement.
 * 
 * The interface is intended as an internal helper to unify the API of the official mvvmFX extensions (Guice and CDI at
 * the moment). It is <strong>not</strong> intended to be used for other use cases.
 * 
 * A mvvmfx extension has to do the following:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Overwrite {@link Application#init()} method with <string>final</string>. In this method the extension can do some
 * bootstrapping (if needed).</li>
 * <li>Call {@link #initMvvmfx()} as last step in the overwritten init method. The contract is that the
 * {@link #initMvvmfx()} is called when the basic container bootstrapping is done so that the user can do her own
 * initialization in this method.</li>
 * <li>Implement {@link Application#start(Stage)} method. In this method own startup logic can be done (if needed).</li>
 * <li>Call {@link #startMvvmfx(Stage)} as last step in the overwritten start method. Pass the stage instance from the
 * original {@link Application#start(Stage)} method to {@link #startMvvmfx(Stage)}.</li>
 * <li>Implement {@link Application#stop()} method. In this method own shutdown logic can be done (if needed).</li>
 * <li>Call {@link #stopMvvmfx()} as last step in the overwritten stop method.</li>
 * </ol>
