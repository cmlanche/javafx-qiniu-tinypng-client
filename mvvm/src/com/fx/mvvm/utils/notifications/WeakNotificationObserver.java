/**
 *
 * This class is a wrapper of a {@link NotificationObserver} that only
 * holds a weak reference to the observer.
 * <p>
 * When using normal {@link NotificationObserver} in combination with the global {@link NotificationObserver}
 * the notification center will hold a reference to the observer as long as it isn't unregistered.
 * The observer itself will most likely hold a reference to the parent class which can prevent
 * the parent class from being garbage collected.
 * In many use cases this is not a problem but in some situations this can cause memory leaks.
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * For such situations this class can be used as a Wrapper around the normal notification observer.
 * The usage should look like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * public class MyClass {
 *
 *     private NotificationObserver observer;
 *
 *     ...
 *
 *     public void someMethod() {
 *         observer = (key, payload) -> {
 *           // do something when observer is called.
 *
 *         };
 *
 *         notificationCenter.subscribe("some_topic", new WeakNotificationObserver(observer));
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The example shows the following steps:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Create a field for your observer of type {@link NotificationObserver}</li>
 *     <li>Create an instance of your observer, for example as a lambda.</li>
 *     <li>subscribe to a topic by creating a new instance of {@link WeakNotificationObserver}
 *     and pass the normal observer as constructor argument</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * It's important to hold a hard reference to the normal observer in your class. This can be done
 * by creating a field for the observer. This way you prevent the observer from being garbage collected to early.
 * Creating  a local variable in the body of a method will <strong>not</strong> work!
 * <p>
 *
 * Using the pattern mentioned above will:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>prevent the observer from being garbage collected to early</li>
 *     <li>allow the garbage collector to collect the parent class as soon as it isn't references in other places</li>
 * </ul>
